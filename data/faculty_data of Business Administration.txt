Research: PUBLISHED RESEARCH BOOKS “ SAARC: Will It Survive? ” - A book which is presumably a work of huge magnitude expressing the immense potential of SAARC, one of the strongest associations of economic cooperation in the world. “Bangladesh RMG Industry: Competitiveness and Productivity ” – An      insightful publication focusing on the  productivity and competitiveness of the Readymade Garments (RMG) sector of Bangladesh “ভারত ও বাংলা ভাগ: এক বিয়োগান্তক অধ্যায়” -  ১৯৪৭ সালের দ্বিজাতীতত্ত্বের বিভাজন সাধারণ মানুষের প্রত্যাশিত ছিল না। সাম্প্রদায়িক চেতনাকে পুঁজি করে রাজনৈতিক প্রতিহিংসার ফসল হলো দাঙ্গা। এই মোক্ষম অস্ত্র ব্যবহার করল রাজনৈতিক নেতারা। যাদের কারোও সাধারণ জনগনের সাথে ছিল না কোন সম্পর্ক। ইংরেজরা তাদের দোসরদের দিয়ে ভারত ও বাংলাকে ভাগ করে দিল। ভারতের হাজার বছরের ইতিহাস এভাবেই বদলে গেল। ভারত ও বাংলা ভাগের প্রকৃত ইতিহাস প্রতিটি বাঙালীরই জানা দরকার।এই প্রেষণা থেকেই ‘ভারত ও বাংলা ভাগ’ বইটি লেখা।
