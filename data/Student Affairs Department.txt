"It is better to debate a question without settling it than to settle a question without debating it." Joseph Joubert, French moralist and essayist.

Motto: IMPOSSIBLE" says itself that "I'M POSSIBLE"

In the current world, where communication is a key in professional field, it can translate one’s thoughts & idea into neatly constructed sentences. Being a part of the debating club it can provide the student the basic training ground. In our highly competitive world it is important to be able to present the ideas in a logical and convincing manner and debating helps to put forward logical thoughts to other. Introduction structure & rules for exchange can provide the necessary tools to further their communication skills through extensive training & inter-university debating competition.

Formal debating introduces structure and rules to an exchange of opinions, giving each participant equal opportunity to present their side of the issue while attempting to prove the opposing side false. The primary commitment of the NUB Debating Club is therefore to help its members improve these skills through extensive training programs and inter-University (including international) competitions, where we test our skills against the debaters from other institutions. We see the external competitions as both an opportunity to demonstrate our prowess, and learn from everyone else. At these debate competitions, you will meet some of the finest speakers of our generation.

We shall call it information technology."
