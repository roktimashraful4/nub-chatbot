Research: Research Assistant Major: Information and Communication Engineering Mobile and Telecommunication Research Laboratory (MTRL) Dept. of Electronics Engineering Former Research Assistant Ultra-Wideband (UWB)– Information Technology Research Center(ITRC) Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering 2008-2012 Completed Research To minimize the required no. of parameters for link adaptation in underwater communication networks using machine learning algorithms due to energy constraint of sensor networks. Using PCA analysis, the dimension of Incheon and Taean sea dataset are reduced, then further analysed in multi-dimensional way using K-nearest Algorithm, Boosted Regression Tree, and Support Vector Machine for better percentage of accuracy. We also try to find out the thresholds for each parameter contributing to the link adaptation. We measure the accuracy also through confusion matrix, display the data distribution through 2D, 3D scatter plot and 3D, 4D interpolated plot.
