Research: My project is entitled “Determination of crystal field splitting energy (Δ0) and Racah parameters (B) of some ligands in Cobalt (III) complexes” In this study, I examined the interaction of Co (III) ion with different ligands and an attempt was taken to calculate the crystal field splitting energy, Δ0 and Racah parameters (B) for every complex from the UV-visible spectral data and their corresponding Tanabe-Sugano diagram. My thesis is entitled “Investigation on mixed ligand complexes of metal theophylline (metal = Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II) and Hg(II)) with ethylenediamine”. The goal of this work was to synthesize, characterize and determine the most probable structure of prepared ternary complexes from the result of various studies. Most important concern of my research was to know the coordinating behaviors of theophylline with transition metal ions, since metal-theophylline complexes have known significant antitumor activity. I had studied on theophylline as well as its compounds. Some characterization techniques were used to characterize the prepared compounds, like UV-visible spectro photometry, TGA, DSC, FT-IR, HPLC, NMR etc.
